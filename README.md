# Simple HTTP Based Go File server

This is a simple go program that will serve files in a specified directory over HTTP.
Compared to Caddy, `serv` is intentionally narrow: it focuses on lightweight static file serving with explicit flags, while Caddy is a full-featured web server and reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS and broader app routing/config support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need to have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your computer.

I used go 1.18, which is the Ubuntu 20.04 default.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/dferris93/serv.git
cd serv
make
```

### Running
By default, serv will run on 127.0.0.1:8889

Once, the program is running, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8889

```

## Example

* Serve files in $HOME/public_html to the entire world on port 8080

```
./serv -dir $HOME/public_html -ip 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 
```

* Serve files in $HOME/public_html to the entire world on port 8080 and log to $HOME/access_log

```
./serv -dir $HOME/public_html -ip 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 -log $HOME/access_log
```

* Make a self signed TLS key pair and serve with it
```
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365

<answer the questions needed for the CSR>

./serv -cacert server.crt -key server.key -port 8443

```

* Use http basic auth
```
./serv -username admin -password admin 
```

* Use http basic auth with environment variables
```
export SERV_USER=admin
export SERV_PASS=admin
./serv -username env:SERV_USER -password env:SERV_PASS
```

* Use http basic auth with a JSON credentials file
```
cat >/tmp/serv-creds.json <<'EOF'
{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}
EOF
./serv -username file:/tmp/serv-creds.json -password file:/tmp/serv-creds.json
```

* Use http basic auth with .htaccess (per-directory override)
```
echo "username: admin" > /path/to/served/.htaccess
echo "password: admin" >> /path/to/served/.htaccess
./serv -dir /path/to/served
```
* If a `.htaccess` file exists in a directory (or any parent up to the served root), its credentials override the CLI `-username`/`-password` for that subtree.

* Use http basic auth with TLS
```
./serv -cacert server.crt -key server.key -username admin -password admin
```

* TLS cert auth
```
 openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca-key.pem
 openssl req -new -x509 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -days 3650 -subj "/CN=My CA"
 openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server-key.pem
 openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem -subj "/CN=localhost"
 openssl x509 -req -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 365
 openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client-key.pem
 openssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out client-csr.pem -subj "/CN=Client"
 openssl x509 -req -in client-csr.pem -CA

 ./serv -cacert ca-cert.pem -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -mtls

#And then on the client
curl https://localhost:8889/ --cert client-cert.pem --key client-key.pem  --cacert ca-cert.pem

```

* Setting Headers
```
./serv -header 'X-Test-Header:Value' -header 'X-Another-Header:Value2' 
```

* IP ACLs
```
./serv -allowedips 192.168.1.0/24,10.10.10.1,172.16.5.0/22
```

* Redirects
```
./serv -redirect '/g:https://www.google.com' -redirect '/a:https://www.amazon.com'
```

* Filter entries from directory listings
```
./serv -filter '*.log' -filter 'node_modules' -filter 'private/*'
```

* Enable browser drag-and-drop uploads (multi-file)
```
./serv -upload
```

* Enable uploads with a 250MB limit and allow overwrites
```
./serv -upload -uploadmaxmb 250 -uploadoverwrite
```

* Enable uploads with no request size limit
```
./serv -upload -uploadmaxmb 0
```

* Upload a file with `curl` (POST to the directory URL)
```
curl -F "files=@./example.txt" http://127.0.0.1:8889/
```

* Upload multiple files with `curl`
```
curl \
  -F "files=@./example.txt" \
  -F "files=@./image.png" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8889/
```

## Notes

* I have not tested TLS with an intermediary certificate chain at all, although it should work the same way it works with nginx where you have to order your ca certificates properly in the cacert file.
* TLS is locked to a minimum of version 1.2.  I really don't recommend changing this.
* By default serv will not follow symlinks outside of the directory tree.
* serv blocks hardlinks by default (use `-insecure` to bypass).
* By default serv will not allow access to dot files (use `-allowdotfiles` to allow them)
* If a `.htaccess` file is present, it is never served to clients, even with `-insecure` or `-allowdotfiles`
* Requests for `.htaccess` or configured TLS cert/key/CA files return 404 (including `.htaccess` parse errors). These files are never listed or served, even if they live in the served tree or are symlinked or hardlinked into it.
* serv will look for an index.html file, if it isn't found, it will serve the entire directory.
* `-filter` patterns also block direct access by URL (404).
* Uploads are disabled by default; enable with `-upload`.
* Uploads respect ACLs and security rules, including auth/IP restrictions, `-filter` patterns, dotfile policy, and sensitive file protections.
* `.htaccess` uploads are always blocked.
* custom headers will only be set if the request is successful
* Logs always include both proxy and client IP fields.
* If X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-IP is set, the proxy and client fields are:
```
ProxyIP ClientIP - - [time] "method path HTTP/Version" responseCode bytesSent
```
* If no proxy is used, the proxy field is `-` and the client field is the remote address:
```
- ClientIP - - [time] "method path HTTP/Version" responseCode bytesSent
```

serv is secure by default, but you have to be intelligent.  If you serve your private ssh keys (or other private data) to the Internet, that's on you.
